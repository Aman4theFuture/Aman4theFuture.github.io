					<p align="center">Born and raised in Atlanta, GA much of Amanuel's spent his early years 'til the age of 5, and moved to the suburbs of Lilburn, Ga. Amanuel
						born as a US citizen, as both of his parents immigrated from Ethiopia. While some might argue the cultural difference between the two might be hard
						and result in me favoring one culture over the other that was not the case. I can now proudly say that I am a bilingual speaker and can now speak fluent Amharic
					  (the official language of Ethiopia).</p>

					<p align="center">Since moving to Lilburn,Ga , a suburb a metro Atlanta, I have loved the community and began extracurricular activities such as soccer and karate.
						 Though later on I dropped karate in favor of soccer when I was in the 4th grade, but not before I earned an orange belt. I continued playing soccer at the local
						 soccer club GSA (Gwinnett Soccer Association) until the end of the 2019 season, and have since been on hiatus due to the pandemic.</p>

					<p align="center">When I graduted from elementary school and moved to middle school, I did so as a Presidential Education Award Program recipient, for "Outstanding Academic Achievment" signed by then president, Barack Obama. With
					   that achievement behind me I went through middle school in a breeze. Then fast forward to 2018-2019 I start as freshman at Parkview Highscool.  </p>

					<p align="center">Freshman year I was learing the handels of high school all the while debating what club I shoud join. Finaly seetinling in with Parkiew's TSA. While I do enjoy technology and is what I am most
					   passionate about I decided to drop it sopthmore year in favor of FBLA. This is the club I realy "clicked" with. I volunteered on FBLA sponsered events such as the Community Partnership Walk during my sopthmore year, where we at FBLA
					   setup a Halloween party for the young community members at the local community center. While I was planing to compete at continue compettion the pandemic interupted those plans.
