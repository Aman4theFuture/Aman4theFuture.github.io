					<p align="center">Amanuel has spent the last four years of high school, building and developing his leadership, communication, time management, and presentation skills. With these
						skills, Amanuel has been able to consistently place as a time in the 3DE program. Some of the companies Amanuel has presented solutions to include:<b> The Home Depot, ReliaQuest, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Sage, SPANX, The
						Buckhead Life Group, SAP, Atlanta Hawks, and Associated Credit Union</b> to name a few.<br> With these skills, Amanuel has been able to create and launch his own small business, <b>PresentED</b>. PresentED was
						made possible using the skills Amanuel attained through various case challenges and enables him to exercise professionalism and effective communication. PresentED is a service-based business where Amanuel makes
						presentations for clients based on documents and rubrics/guidelines submitted by the client. Notable uses of PresentED services have been by teachers and the 3DE Director, Nikki Thornton, for the <b>3DE Virtual Summer
						Teacher Training</b> event. Where products made by PresentED have been used to train teachers and showcase what a case challenge winning presentation looks like.<br> As of Amanuel's senior year, he has employed his ability
						and knowledge in making websites for his school club, DECA. Currently, he has additional orders from his teachers and other school faculty to create a school store, school print shop, and a 3DE Market Day website.<br>
						In his free time, Amanuel enjoys hanging out with his friends and playing soccer. On an occasional  rainy day, Amanuel has been know to snag a good book, typically sci-fi, and read for hours on end. In addition, Amanuel
						participates in group activities from both school and extracurriculars such as, DECA, BDPA, GSA, and volunteering at his church. <br>Those who have worked with Amanuel in the past, have found him to be an out-of-the-box thinker, a democratic
						leader, and a team player that is very, deadline-oriented. </p>
